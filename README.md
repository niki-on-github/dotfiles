# .dotfiles

A Repository to make a subset of my dotfiles public. Feel free to look around. Be aware that I have configured my environment to fit my workflow.

**NOTE**: I use a local git server for my dotfiles and only a part of it is uploaded to github. Also, some (a lot of) configuration files and scripts are not up to date, so the interfaces do not always match.
