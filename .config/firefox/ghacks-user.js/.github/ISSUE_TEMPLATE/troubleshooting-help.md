Before you proceed...
  - Issues will be closed as invalid if you do not [troubleshoot](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/1.4-Troubleshooting), including
     - confirming the problem is caused by the `user.js`
     - searching the `[Setup` tags in the `user.js`
  - Search the GitHub repository. The information you need is most likely here already.
  - Note: We do not support forks
