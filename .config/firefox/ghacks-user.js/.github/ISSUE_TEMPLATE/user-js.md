We value feedback in general, but we value feedback from informed users more. There is no need for you to be an expert to participate (most of us aren't), but we hope that you at least understand our decisions before questioning them. We discuss all changes openly, and we do not make changes lightly. So, if you don't understand why we decided to add/remove/change a certain pref, search the repo. The answer is most certainly here.

If some change we made took you by surprise (in the wrong way), remember that keeping track of changes is your responsibility. Watch the repo, read the [changelogs](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Achangelog), compare [releases](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/releases) as you update your copy of user.js, or use any other method you prefer.

Clear all of this when you're ready to type.
