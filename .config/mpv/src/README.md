# MPV User Scripts (Source Code Directory)

MPV user scripts allow you to add functions that are not part of the core of the mpv player. Most of these scripts are unofficial 3rd party scripts! Scripts are placed in `~/.config/mpv/scripts/`. This folder contains the corresponding source code files of the scripts (if they have to be compiled). I will commit the compiled scripts (`~/.config/mpv/scripts/`) in my dotfile repository. The source files are mostly included as git submodules and allow to compile and install a newer version of the mpv user script.
