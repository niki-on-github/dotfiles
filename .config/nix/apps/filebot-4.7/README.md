# filebot-4.7

FileBot is the ultimate tool for renaming and organizing your movies, TV shows and Anime. Match and rename media files against online databases. The Version 7.7.x is the latest version that can be used without license. Some of the Online Scraper are broken. I only use this to rename some TV Shows. For everything else i recommend [MediaElch](https://github.com/komet/mediaelch).

My workflow:

1. `Fetch Data` from `The MovieDB`
2. `Load` your Season Folder
3. `Match` the Files
4. Verify the match is correct
5. `Rename`
